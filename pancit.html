  <h2>Filipino Pancit</h2>
  <p>Pancit is a type of Filipino noodle dish. The noodles may vary depending on the kind of pancit recipe being prepared. For example, this recipe makes use of rice noodles called bihon. Flour sticks or noodle is also used to make pancit canton, pancit habhab, and pancit bato.</p>
  <p>The chicken meat that I used from this pancit recipe was from the leg quarters. I use chicken leg quarters most of the time for dishes such as this because it is cheaper and tasty too. I started by boiling the chicken in water. This process totally cooked the chicken and made it tender. As a bonus, chicken stock was produced in the process. This means that we saved more money because we do not need to buy chicken stock to make our pancit.</p>

    <li>1 1/2 lbs. chicken with bones and skin on</li>
    <li>1/2 lb. bihon noodles rice sticks</li>

    <li>Remove the boiled chicken from the cooking pot. Let it cool down. Shred the meat and discard the bones. Set aside. Note: do not throw the water yet, we will use it later as chicken stock.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, soak the sotanghon and bihon noodles in water for 10 minutes. Set aside. Note: do this by using a large mixing bowl and fill it with tap water.</li>
